# software system for cafe business for my university cafe

From what I saw in Fenerbah√ße University's cafe, the software side of the cafe system was quite complex and unnecessarily difficult to use. In my senior year at university, I prepared a cafe software tracking system with a simple interface.


## Used technologies

**Client:** React, Redux, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (https://github.com/hasangkz/fbucks_backend)
